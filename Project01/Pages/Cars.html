    <p class="two" >I love cars and been a fan of cars since i started driving, I might sound cringe but cars is one of my hobbies. I enjoy going to car meets weekly or by weekyly with my friends and cousins to watch car shows and see many different specs/cars. These shows will bring you a thrift of drifts, smoke in the face and even sometimes people getting hit so be on your own. Come with me next time and i'll show you what a blast it is.</p>
