	<h1>All About XML & JavaScript</h1>
	<h2>XML</h2>
	<h3>What is XML? </h3>
	<p>XML is a markup language for storing and transmitting data. It uses tags to describe the structure and meaning of data in a document. XML files are human readable and understandable by humans and machines. It is mainly used for data storage, configuration data and data exchange between systems. XML allows custom markup to be created and can be validated against a predefined standard.</p>
	<h3>How is XML used? </h3>
	<ol>Data storage: XML provides a structured format for storing data. It allows you to define your own labels and organize data hierarchically, making it suitable for representing complex data.</ol>
	<ol>Data Exchange: XML supports data exchange between different systems. It works as a format that can be understood by many platforms and programming languages. XML files can be shared between systems, allowing collaboration.</ol>
<ol>Configuration file: XML is often used to store configuration information for software applications. Using XML, developers can define a structure to store and store configuration information, making it easier to manage and update sites.</ol>
<ol>Web Services: XML is an essential part of many Web Service protocols such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer). XML is used to create messages that are exchanged between clients and servers, allowing complex data to be transferred</ol>
<ol> Document Transformation: XML can be converted using technologies such as XSLT (Extensible Style Sheet Language Transformation).
This allows XML files to be converted to various formats such as HTML or PDF using text editors and rules</ol>
<ol> Metadata and markup: XML is used to define metadata and add structure to content. It facilitates its processing and interpretation by enabling the inclusion of additional information about the disclosed data.</ol>

	<h2>JavaScript</h2>
	<h3>What is JavaScript? </h3>
	<ol>JavaScript is a high-level programming language commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. They are often embedded in HTML files and executed by web browsers to improve website functionality and user experience.</ol>
	<h3>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS? </h3> 
	<p>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the three core technologies used in web development that work together to create dynamic and interactive web pages.</p>
<ol>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the structure and content of web pages. It defines the elements that make up the image of a web page, such as sentences, paragraphs, images, and links.</ol>

<ol>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the presentation and layout of HTML elements. It allows developers to define standards such as colors, fonts, spacing and layout to customize the look of web pages.</ol>
<ol>JavaScript improves the functionality and interaction of web pages. It is a programming language that can be embedded in an HTML form or included as a separate JavaScript file. JavaScript supports actions and reactions based on user input or events, such as form validation, content modification, and UI development.</ol>
	<h3>What are some common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions?</h3>
	<h4>~Elements~</h4>
<ol>Variables: JavaScript allows declaring and modifying variables to store and manipulate data.</ol>
<ol>Arrays: Arrays are used to store collections of values ​​in JavaScript.</ol>
<ol>Object: Objects used to represent complex data and allow objects and methods to be defined in them.</ol>
<h4>~Properties~</h4>
<ol>
Length: The length property is used to specify the number of elements in a string or the number of characters in a string.
InnerHTML: The innerHTML property is used to add or modify HTML content in an element.
Value: The value property is used to assign or set the value of an input field or form. 
</ol>
<h4>Methods:</h4>

<ol>GetElementById(): This method is used to get elements from an HTML document based on its unique identifier.</ol>
<ol>QuerySelector(): The querySelector() method is used to select content based on the CSS style selector.</ol>
<ol>Push(): The push() method is used to add one or more items to the end of the array.</ol>
<h4>Function:</h4>

<ol>Alert(): The alert() function displays a popup dialog with the specified message.</ol>
